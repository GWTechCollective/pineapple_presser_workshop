# Pineapple Presser
This repo contains the code to the JavaScript workshop. The index.html file only loads the basic \<div\> sections, which are color-coded if you look at the final site (left, middle, and right). 

### What Stuff Should I Care About?
The javascript files (since this is a JS workshop, after all) are located in /static/js, and the file we write in the workshop 
is the pineapple.js file- this file is what actually adds the functionality to our site. The other 2 JavaScript files we don't need to worry about, they're just libraries that we use inside the pineapple.js file. 

#### So What's Up With the Other Folders?
The css folder has, you guessed it, css files. Writing CSS was not the focus of the workshop, so we just assumed it was already 
made when we went over writing javascript. If you're interested in the design aspect of the site, then feel free to look 
through the SASS file styles.scss, which is where we load all of our colors, fonts, and other misc. style elements. 

The /static/media folder stores all of our images, which include the clickable pineapple, and the different cursor images.
